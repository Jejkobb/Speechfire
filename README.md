## Usage üìù

### 1. Start the server (don't forget to activate the environment first)

#### By creating a system tray icon

This has only been tested on Windows and Pop_OS! (Ubuntu), but should work on any Linux system that supports the `appindicator3` library. You also need to install the following dependencies:

- **Linux:** `sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1`

```bash
python system-tray/start_tray_linux.py
# or
python system-tray/start_tray_windows.py
```

Locate the tray icon in your system tray, right click it and select "Start Server".

### 2. Record audio

- Place your cursor on a text field in Firefox.
- Press `ctrl+alt+s` to start recording.
- Press `ctrl+alt+s` to stop recording.
- The transcription will be displayed in the focused text field.

### 3. Stop the server when you're done

#### Directly

```bash
ctrl+c
```

#### By stopping the system tray icon

Right click the system tray icon and select "Stop Server". To stop the process, right click the icon and select "Exit".
